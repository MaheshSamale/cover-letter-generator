**Setup Your AI-Powered Chrome Extension Locally**

Follow these steps to install and run the Chrome extension on your local machine:  


### **Step 1: Clone or Download the Project**  
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository or download the source code to your local system.

git clone https://github.com/MaheshSamale/cover-letter-generator.git

If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract it and navigate to the extracted folder.

### **Step 2: Replace the Google Gemini API Key**  
Your extension uses Google Gemini for AI-powered features.  

1. Open the project folder in any code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
2. Locate the `From.js` file inside the `components` folder.
3. Find the placeholder for the Google Gemini API key.
4. Replace it with your actual API key.  
   Example:

   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = "your-google-gemini-api-key";
   ```

5. Save the file.

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. If not, download and install it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).  

Then, open a terminal inside your project folder and run:  

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all required dependencies.

### **Step 4: Build the Extension**  
Run the following command to create the production build:  

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder containing the final files for your Chrome extension.
